Meta Defender has assembled a team of experienced insurance specialists, including actuaries and financial analysts, to provide fair, open, objective, and transparent opinions and claims evaluations.
When a policyholder files a claim, the protocol will thoroughly analyze the opinions of both expert evaluators and community members before deciding whether and how to pay the claim.
Similarly, when the protocol needs a vote on whether to introduce a new insurance program, it will consider both parties' perspectives.
In the future, Meta Defender token hodlers will find more diverse applications in more DeFi scenarios.
