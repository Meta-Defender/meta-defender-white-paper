In this paper, we present Meta Dedender, a novel automated protocol for trading insurance deployed in blockchains.
Prior to the protocols before, we present several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Dynamic Pricing Model} : We modified the option pricing model to make it acceptable for buying and selling policies.
	The pricing model will automatically compute the price of each insurance based on the policy's period and coverage.
	\item \textit{EpochManagement in Trading} : The epoch is included to prevent lengthy loops in computation.
	We divided the timeline into discrete epochs so that others might deposit and withdraw independently.
	We can simply compute how much one's asset is locked and how much one receives in incentives using the epoch.
	\item \textit{Rug Pull Token Collection} : Unlike other risk-coverage protocols.
	MetaDefender assesses policyholder claims and collects rug pull tokens from these policyholders to rescue the rug pull community.
	With all of these rug pull tokens locked, we will play a significant part in securing the project and helping to rebuild the community.
