In this paper, we present Meta Defender, a novel automated protocol for trading insurance deployed in blockchains.
Prior to the protocols before, we present several advantages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item \textit{Dynamic Pricing Model} : We modified the option pricing model to make it acceptable for buying and selling policies.
	The pricing model will automatically compute the price of each insurance based on the policy's period and coverage.
	\item \textit{EpochManagement in Trading} : The epoch is included to prevent lengthy loops in computation.
	We divided the timeline into discrete epochs so that others might deposit and withdraw independently.
	We can simply compute how much one's asset is locked and how much one receives in incentives using the epoch.
	\item \textit{Rekt affect Token Collection} : Unlike other risk-coverage protocols.
	MetaDefender collects rekt affect tokens from the policyholders to rescue the rekt affect community.
	The toxic assets resulting from DeFi REKT won't simply be cast aside as waste.
	The disposition of these assets and the resultant income streams also provide additional possibility, propelling all participants towards further progress in the realm of Web3.
	Both underwriters and policyholders reap the benefits mentioned above as well as the subsequent DEF rewards.
	With all of these rekt affect tokens locked, we will play a significant part in rescuing the project.
