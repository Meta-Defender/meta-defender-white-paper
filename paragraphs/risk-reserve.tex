DeFi insurance methods must provide the underwriters with a rate of return equivalent to market alternatives.
Payouts are infrequent with insurance capital, whether underwritten or not, and the capital sits dormant for the most of the time.
To maximize underwriter returns, we will invest a portion of the latent insurance funds in low-risk DeFi portfolios while keeping a payout reserve.
The majority of the earnings on these investments will go to the underwriters, with the rest of them going to the risk reserve.

Risk reserve acts as a buffer in the protocol by collecting some of the mining rewards.
When the risk reserve is sufficient to cover the claim amount, it will pay the policyholder directly rather than using capital from the main pool.
